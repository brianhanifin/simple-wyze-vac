# Simple Wyze Vacuum for Home Assistant

## NOTE As of 8/20/2021 

Wyze has recently implemented a rate limit on accessing their private APIs. Due to this change, ~~I cannot recommend installing this integration in HA until this all gets sorted out. I might resort to adding a "send_command" that maybe you can use to query Wyze servers. This way it's more event based and it will be on you to make sure you don't hit the rate limits.~~ I have **disabled polling** on this integration.

To update the state of the device, you can do a `vacuum.send_command` with command `update` which will update the state of the vacuum. See vacuum-card example for an implementation.

## General

Simple implementation of the Wyze Vacuum right into Home Assistant. 

## Prerequisites
- Home Assistant ðŸ˜…
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) Installed in Home Assistant
- Wyze Account without 2FA - Tip: Create a new account that you share just the vacuum with that doesn't have 2FA enabled.

## Installation
1. On Home Assistant go to HACS -> Integration
2. Click menu on the top right
3. Click on custom repositories
4. Add https://github.com/romedtino/simple-wyze-vac as an Integration
5. Edit your configuration.yaml and add
```yaml
simple_wyze_vac:
  username: your_wyze_email@email.com
  password: your_wyze_password
```
6. Verify your configuration file is valid
7. Restart Home Assistant

If it all worked out, you should now have Wyze vacuum entity(ies)

## Supported Features
- Start
- Stop / Pause
- Return to Base
- Room Clean (Must use serivce call) Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18567128/127786476-ec3dbfcd-66f4-40e6-bfe5-fda0edad191d.png)

```yaml
service: vacuum.send_command
data:
  command: sweep_rooms
  params:
    rooms:
      - Hallway
      - Kitchen
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.theovac
```

- Fan Speed control - `quiet` `standard` `strong` Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18567128/128625430-29f77538-b638-481e-8221-0e10ff8618a9.png)

```yaml
service: vacuum.set_fan_speed
data:
  fan_speed: quiet
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.your_vac
```
- Battery Level
- Update status - Since the integration no longer polls, you can query the status of the vacuum by sending a custom command `update`

```yaml
service: vacuum.send_command
data:
  command: update
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.theovac
```

- Refresh Login Token - You can also refresh the login token if it has been awhile since you queried status and your login token has expired

```yaml
service: vacuum.send_command
data:
  command: refresh_token
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.theovac
```

## Misc
- Location is not supported but it is considered "supported" by HA so the button doesn't crash the component when using vacuum-card if you use it.

## Implementing vacuum-card
There's a lovely Lovelace vacuum-card [here](https://github.com/denysdovhan/vacuum-card) in which you can implement your vacuum like so:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18567128/134234543-545b1b1d-ab08-4c0d-98e3-8b96356d68d1.png)

Here is my YAML configuration of the card

```yaml
type: custom:vacuum-card
entity: vacuum.theovac
image: default
show_toolbar: true
show_status: true
show_name: true
compact_view: false
actions:
  - name: Clean living room
    service: script.vacuum_room_clean
    icon: mdi:sofa
    service_data:
      rooms:
        - Living Room
  - name: Update
    service: script.vacuum_update_state
    icon: mdi:update

```
and the contents of the scripts it invokes
```yaml
alias: Vacuum Room Clean
variables:
  rooms:
    - Living Room
sequence:
  - service: vacuum.send_command
    data:
      command: sweep_rooms
      params:
        rooms: ' {{ rooms }} '
    target:
      entity_id: vacuum.theovac
mode: single

```
```yaml
alias: Vacuum Update State
sequence:
  - service: vacuum.send_command
    data:
      command: update
    target:
      entity_id: vacuum.theovac
mode: single
```



## TODO / Maybe in the Future
- In theory everything from wyze-sdk should be possible?
